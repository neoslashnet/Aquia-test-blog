# Who we are

Aquia is a developer-centric company, passionate about the intersection of security and velocity. We believe in
guardrails over roadblocks, and security as an enabler. Our team has extensive experience building and implementing
security solutions at scale across the public sector, enterprise, and top technology companies.

We keep our promises by delivering stellar results, on time and on target. We use data to drive decisions, and add value
quickly via agile execution and incremental planning. We thoroughly document our work, codify or automate our solutions
, and rigorously train our counterparts.

# Our Values

## Trust

We understand that the trust between Aquia, our partners,and customers isn’t just critical to the success of our
business, it’s a potential National Security concern. Therefore, we insist that our employees and agents always defer to
truth and transparency in any situation, and our executive team is committed to living this value and leading by example.

## Accountability

Our consultants are owners, fully-accountable for their assigned tasks or projects. We act on behalf of the
mission, are team-players, and won’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. We communicate changes, issues,
or concerns promptly and clearly and take full responsibility for the work we deliver.

## Culture

We recognize a diverse, thoroughly-trained, well-equipped, and highly-motivated workforce as a consulting company's
single greatest asset. Therefore, we prioritize learning and professional development, offer opportunities for growth,
and are intentional about giving everyone a voice. We also provide remote work options, excellent compensation, great
benefits, and equity plans.

# Our Mission

We started this company to challenge, or even disrupt the GovCon status quo. As the threat landscape continues to evolve
and competition for cyber talent increases, we believe the timing is right for a different kind of cybersecurity
company; one that can marry industry-leading expertise with the government's toughest security challenges.

Under the legacy model, many companies focus the majority of their efforts on capture and expansion. This can cause them
to lose sight of the goal, focus less of their efforts on a delivery, and ultimately reduce the value of the engagement
for the mission owner and taxpayer.

At Aquia, we have a strong bias for transformational work. We want to upskill and enable existing teams, not replace
them. We are passionate about moving the needle forward and making a measurable impact on readiness, visibility,
maturity, time-to-remediate, and overall cyber risk.
